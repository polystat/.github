[Polystat](https://www.polystat.org) is a polyglot experimental static analyzer, which 
1) takes your source code written in Java/C++/Python/etc., 
2) converts it to [EOLANG](https://www.eolang.org), 
3) then EO objects to [ùúë-calculus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13384) expressions,
and then 
4) tells you where are the bugs.

The following products are still not created:

  * EO to [ARM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture)/[x86](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86) compiler (maybe as [GCC frontend](https://gcc.gnu.org/frontends.html))
  * EO plugin for [IntelliJ IDEA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IntelliJ_IDEA)
  * EO [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) interfacere
  * EO to Ruby/JavaScript/Go/PHP compilers
  * ARM/x86 to EO "decompiler"
